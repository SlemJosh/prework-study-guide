# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This prework study guide was an opportunity to learn and practice some of the basic principles of web design.  I had a chance to go through HTML, CSS, JavaScript and lots of Git tutorials that helped me get
introduced to these topics, but it also gave me a glimpse of what the work of a developer might entail.  Was able to implement new ideas and more importantly learn the process of debugging as I had to fix errors
that were made in implementing the new topics.  By far the most important thing I learned through this whole process was the usage of branches and working on a project in little steps, while preserving the integrity
of the overall project.

## Usage

This webpage took several steps to complete. Through each step I was introduced to a new concept and how it works.  The notes that I kept were some of the ones suggested but also a few that really spoke to me.
The example of building a house was very helpful.  As with HTML I figured out the blueprint of how I wanted my house to be constructed. Then was able to add some design with the CSS sections.  JavaScript was particularly
interesting as it added functionality that at first glance isn't even present on the page itself. It got into some real fundamental coding practices with functions and looking at how to express variables.  It's very useful 
that the function put in there allows random choice of which subject to dive into.
